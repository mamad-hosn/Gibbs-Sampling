# Gibbs-Sampling
A project is undertaken with the objective of utilizing Gibbs sampling to estimate the distribution and its parameters. The Gibbs sampling algorithm is employed iteratively to draw samples from the conditional distributions while holding other variables fixed, enabling the determination of the underlying distribution and its associated parameters.
